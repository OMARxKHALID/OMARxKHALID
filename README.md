👋 Hi, I’m @OMARxKHALID, a solution-driven FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER. I'm adept at contributing to highly collaborative work environments, finding solutions, and ensuring customer satisfaction.

👀 I’m interested in creating consumer-focused websites and web applications that meet the highest standards in design, user experience, best practices, and speed. I have a strong background in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT.JS, VUE.JS, PHP, and I've also worked with technologies like Node.JS, Express.JS and Laravel for building robust backend systems and web projects. Additionally, I've applied machine learning techniques to enhance data-driven decision-making.
